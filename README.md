# Comprehensive Analytics Workbench: Regression Modeling and Twitter Data Exploration

This repository presents a comprehensive analytics workbench that combines regression modeling techniques with an open-ended exploratory analysis task on Twitter data. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with various regression algorithms, feature engineering methods, model selection strategies, and creative problem-solving skills through the exploration of a real-world dataset.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Regression Analysis**: This section focuses on applying different regression techniques to two datasets: the Diamond Characteristics dataset and the Wine Quality dataset. The techniques explored include:

   - Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares, Lasso, Ridge)
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Neural Networks
   - Random Forest Regression
   - LightGBM and CatBoost with Bayesian Optimization

2. **Twitter Data Exploration**: In this section, you will showcase your creativity and problem-solving skills by designing an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a Twitter dataset related to the Super Bowl event. This open-ended task allows you to explore various techniques, feature engineering methods, and evaluation strategies to accomplish a specific goal, such as sentiment analysis, time-series prediction, or any other task of your choice.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the provided datasets, including correlation analysis, distribution analysis, and data visualization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implement techniques for handling categorical features, feature standardization, and feature selection to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate various regression models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, neural networks, random forests, LightGBM, and CatBoost, using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation strategies.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters of LightGBM or CatBoost models for optimal performance.
- **Twitter Data Exploration**: Design and implement an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the Twitter dataset, showcasing your creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to integrate various techniques learned throughout the course.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation, including a report explaining your approaches, findings, and insights for both the regression analysis and the Twitter data exploration tasks, as well as a README file for running the code.
